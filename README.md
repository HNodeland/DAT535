# DAT535 Project - Earthquake Predictions

*Authors: Haakon Vollheim Webb, HÃ¥kon Nodeland*

To run this project, download the dataset [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/the-ultimate-earthquake-dataset-from-1990-2023)

Unzip the file, and change the input_file variable in unstructure.py, line #61, to the unzipped data's location.

Run unstructure.py, and the unstructured data will be added to the data-folder.



When the data has been unstructured into unstrucutre.txt and uploaded on hdfs, the notebook should run with the correct filepaths.
